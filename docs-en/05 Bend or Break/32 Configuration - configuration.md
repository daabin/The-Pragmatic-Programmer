When code relies on values that may change after the
application has gone live, keep those values external to the app. When
your application will run in different environments, and potentially for
different customers, keep the environment- and customer-specific values
outside the app. In this way, you're parameterizing your application;
the code adapts to the places it runs.

**Tip 55: Parameterize Your App Using External Configuration**

<a id="d24e16603"></a>
Common things you will probably want to put in configuration data
include:

- Credentials for external services (database, third party APIs, and so
  on)
- Logging levels and destinations
- Port, IP address, machine, and cluster names the app uses
- Environment-specific validation parameters
- Externally set parameters, such as tax rates
- Site-specific formatting details
- License keys

<a id="d24e16677"></a>
Basically, look for anything that you know will have to change that you
can express outside your main body of code, and slap it into some
configuration bucket.

### Static Configuration

<a id="d24e16682"></a>
Many frameworks, and quite a few custom applications, keep configuration
in either flat files or database tables. If the information is in flat
files, the trend is to use some off-the-shelf plain-text format.
Currently YAML and JSON are popular for this. Sometimes applications
written in scripting languages use special purpose source-code files,
dedicated to containing just configuration. If the information is
structured, and is likely to be changed by the customer (sales tax
rates, for example), it might be better to store it in a database table.
And, of course, you can use both, splitting the configuration
information according to use.

<a id="d24e16698"></a>
Whatever form you use, the configuration is read into your application
as a data structure, normally when the application starts. Commonly,
this data structure is made global, the thinking being that this makes
it easier for any part of the code to get to the values it holds.

<a id="d24e16700"></a>
We prefer that you don't do that. Instead, wrap the configuration
information behind a (thin) API. This decouples your code from the
details of the representation of configuration.

### Configuration-As-A-Service

<a id="d24e16724"></a>
While static configuration is common, we currently favor a different
approach. We still want configuration data kept external to the
application, but rather than in a flat file or database, we'd like to
see it stored behind a service API. This has a number of benefits:

- Multiple applications can share configuration information, with
  authentication and access control limiting what each can see
- Configuration changes can be made globally
- The configuration data can be maintained via a specialized UI
- The configuration data becomes dynamic

<a id="d24e16743"></a>
That last point, that configuration should be dynamic, is critical as we
move toward highly available applications. The idea that we should have
to stop and restart an application to change a single parameter is
hopelessly out of touch with modern realities. Using a configuration service, components of the application
could register for notifications of updates to parameters they use, and
the service could send them messages containing new values if and when
they are changed.

<a id="d24e16745"></a>
Whatever form it takes, configuration data drives the runtime behavior
of an application. When configuration values change, there's no need to
rebuild the code.

### Don't Write Dodo-Code

<a id="d24e16750"></a>
Without external configuration, your code is not as adaptable or
flexible as it could be. Is this a bad thing? Well, out here in the
real world, species that don't adapt die.

<a id="d24e16754"></a>
<a id="FNPTR-45"></a>
The dodo didn't adapt to the presence of humans and their livestock on
the island of Mauritius, and quickly became extinct.[[45]](#FOOTNOTE-45) It was
the first documented extinction of a species at the hand of man.

<a id="d24e16763"></a>
Don't let your project (or your career) go the way of the dodo.

Don't Overdo It

In the first edition of this book, we suggested using configuration instead of code in a similar fashion, but apparently should have been a little more specific in our instructions. Any advice can be taken to extremes or used inappropriately, so here are a few cautions:

Don't overdo it. One early client of ours decided that every single field in their application should be configurable. As a result, it took weeks to make even the smallest change, as you had to implement both the field and all the admin code to save and edit it. They had some 40,000 configuration variables and a coding nightmare on their hands.

Don't push decisions to configuration out of laziness. If there's
genuine debate about whether a feature should work this way or that,
or if it should be the users' choice, try it out one way and get
feedback on whether the decision was a good one.

macro facility; an example of this is the Monad library in
hex. You could also use Elixir's with construct, but then you lose
much of the sense of writing transformations that you get with
pipelines.
