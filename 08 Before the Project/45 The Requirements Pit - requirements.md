## Topic 45. The Requirements Pit

<a id="d24e24372"></a>
Many books and tutorials refer to requirements gathering as an early
phase of the project. The word “gathering” seems to imply a tribe of
happy analysts, foraging for nuggets of wisdom that are lying on the
ground all around them while the Pastoral Symphony plays gently in the
background. “Gathering” implies that the requirements are already
there—you need merely find them, place them in your basket, and be
merrily on your way.

<a id="d24e24381"></a>
It doesn't quite work that way. Requirements rarely lie on the
surface. Normally, they're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions,
misconceptions, and politics. Even worse, often they don't really exist
at all.

**Tip 75: No One Knows Exactly What They Want**

### The Requirements Myth

<a id="d24e24392"></a>
In the early days of software, computers were more valuable (in terms of
amortized cost per hour) than the people who worked with them. We saved
money by trying to get things correct the first time. Part of that
process was trying to specify exactly what we were going to get the
machine to do. We'd start by getting a specification of the
requirements, parlay that into a design document, then into flowcharts
and pseudo code, and finally into code. Before feeding it into a
computer, though, we'd spend time desk checking it.

<a id="d24e24403"></a>
It cost a lot of money. And that cost meant that people only tried to
automate something when they knew exactly what they wanted. As
early machines were fairly limited, the scope of problems they solved
was constrained: it was actually possible to understand the whole
problem before you started.

<a id="d24e24408"></a>
But that is not the real world. The real world is messy, conflicted, and
unknown. In that world, exact specifications of anything are rare, if
not downright impossible.

<a id="d24e24410"></a>
That's where we programmers come in. Our job is to help people
understand what they want. In fact, that's probably our most valuable
attribute. And it's worth repeating:

**Tip 76: Programmers Help People Understand What They Want**

### Programming as Therapy

<a id="d24e24425"></a>
Let's call the people who ask us to write software our clients.

<a id="d24e24446"></a>
The typical client comes to us with a need. The need may be strategic,
but it is just as likely to be a tactical issue: a response to a current
problem. The need may be for a change to an existing system or it may
ask for something new. The need will sometimes be expressed in business
terms, and sometimes in technical ones.

<a id="d24e24448"></a>
The mistake new developers often make is to take this statement of need
and implement a solution for it.

<a id="d24e24450"></a>
In our experience, this initial statement of need is not an absolute
requirement. The client may not realize this, but it is really an
invitation to explore.

<a id="d24e24452"></a>
Let's take a simple example.

<a id="d24e24454"></a>
You work for a publisher of paper and electronic books. You're given a
new requirement:

<a id="d24e24457"></a>
> Shipping should be free on all orders costing $50 or more.

<a id="d24e24459"></a>
Stop for a second and imagine yourself in that position. What's the
first thing that comes to mind?

<a id="d24e24461"></a>
The chances are very good that you had questions:

- Does the $50 include tax?
- Does the $50 include current shipping charges?
- Does the $50 have to be for paper books, or can the order also include
  ebooks?
- What kind of shipping is offered? Priority? Ground?
- What about international orders?
- How often will the $50 limit change in the future?

<a id="d24e24483"></a>
That's what we do. When given something that seems simple, we annoy
people by looking for edge cases and asking about them.

<a id="d24e24485"></a>
The chances are the client will have already thought of some of these,
and just assumed that the implementation would work that way. Asking the
question just flushes that information out.

<a id="d24e24487"></a>
But other questions will likely be things that the client hadn't
previously considered. That's where things get interesting, and where a
good developer learns to be diplomatic.

<a id="d24e24491"></a>
<a id="d24e24494"></a>
<a id="d24e24497"></a>
<a id="d24e24500"></a>
<a id="d24e24503"></a>
<a id="d24e24505"></a>
<a id="d24e24508"></a>
You:
:   We were wondering about the $50 total. Does that include what we'd
    normally charge for shipping?

Client:
:   Of course. It's the total they'd pay us.

You:
:   That's nice and simple for our customers to understand: I can see the
    attraction. But I can see some less scrupulous customers trying to game
    that system.

Client:
:   How so?

You:
:   Well, let's say they buy a book for $25, and then select overnight
    shipping, the most expensive option. That'll likely be about $30, making
    the whole order $55. We'd then make the shipping free, and they'd get
    overnight shipping on a $25 book for just $25.

    (At this point the experienced developer stops. Deliver facts, and let
    the client make the decisions,)

Client:
:   Ouch. That certainly wasn't what I intended; we'd lose money on those
    orders. What are the options?

<a id="d24e24510"></a>
And this starts an exploration. Your role in this is to interpret what
the client says and to feed back to them the implications. This is both
an intellectual process and a creative one: you're thinking on your feet
and you're contributing to a solution that is likely to be better than
one that either you or the client would have produced alone.

### Requirements Are a Process

<a id="d24e24515"></a>
In the previous example, the developer took the requirements and
fed-back a consequence to the client. This initiated the exploration.
During that exploration, you are likely to come up with more feedback as
the client plays with different solutions. This is the reality of all
requirements gathering:

**Tip 77: Requirements Are Learned in a Feedback Loop**

<a id="d24e24537"></a>
Your job is to help the client understand the consequences of their
stated requirements. You do that by generating feedback, and letting
them use that feedback to refine their thinking.

<a id="d24e24539"></a>
In the previous example, the feedback was easy to express in words.
Sometimes that's not the case. And sometimes you honestly won't know
enough about the domain to be as specific as that.

<a id="d24e24541"></a>
In those cases, Pragmatic Programmers rely on the “is this what you
meant?” school of feedback. We produce mockups and prototypes, and let
the client play with them. Ideally the things we produce are flexible
enough that we can change them during our discussions with the client,
letting us respond to “that isn't what I meant” with “so more like
this?”

<a id="d24e24552"></a>
Sometimes these mockups can be thrown together in an hour or so. They
are obviously just hacks to get an idea across.

<a id="d24e24554"></a>
But the reality is that all of the work we do is actually some form of
mockup. Even at the end of a project we're still interpreting what our
client wants. In fact, by that point we're likely to have more clients:
the QA people, operations, marketing, and maybe even test groups of
customers.

<a id="d24e24559"></a>
So the Pragmatic Programmer looks at all of the project as a
requirements gathering exercise. That's why we prefer short iterations;
ones that end with direct client feedback. This keeps us on track, and
makes sure that if we do go in the wrong direction, the amount of time
lost is minimized.

### Walk in Your Client's Shoes

<a id="d24e24570"></a>
<a id="FNPTR-70"></a>
There's a simple technique for getting inside your clients' heads
that isn't used often enough: become a client. Are you writing a system
for the help desk? Spend a couple of days monitoring the phones with
an experienced support person. Are you automating a manual stock
control system? Work in the warehouse for a week.[[70]](<Topic 48. The Essence of Agility - essence_of_agility.md#FOOTNOTE-70>)

<a id="d24e24579"></a>
As well as giving
you insight into how the system will really be used, you'd
be amazed at how the request “May I sit in for a week while you do
your job?'' helps build trust and establishes a basis for
communication with your clients. Just remember not to get in the way!

**Tip 78: Work with a User to Think Like a User**

<a id="d24e24593"></a>
Gathering feedback is also the time to start to
build a rapport with your client base, learning their expectations and
hopes for the system you are building. See
Topic 52, [*Delight Your Users*](<../09 Pragmatic Projects/52 Delight Your Users - delight.md#delight>), for more.

### Requirements vs. Policy

<a id="d24e24600"></a>
Let's imagine that while discussing a Human Resources system, a
client says “Only an employee's supervisors and the personnel
department may view that employee's records.” Is this statement truly
a requirement? Perhaps today, but it embeds business policy in an
absolute statement.

<a id="d24e24611"></a>
Business policy? Requirement? It's a relatively subtle distinction, but
it's one that will have profound implications for the developers. If the
requirement is stated as “Only supervisors and personnel can view an
employee record,” the developer may end up coding an explicit test
every time the application accesses this data. However, if the
statement is “Only authorized users may access an employee record,”
the developer will probably design and implement some kind of access
control system. When policy changes (and it will), only the metadata for
that system will need to be updated. In fact, gathering requirements in
this way naturally leads you to a system that is well factored to
support metadata.

<a id="d24e24613"></a>
In fact, there's a general rule here:

**Tip 79: Policy Is Metadata**

<a id="d24e24633"></a>
Implement the general case, with the policy information as an example
of the type of thing the system needs to support.

### Requirements vs. Reality

<a id="d24e24639"></a>
<a id="FNPTR-71"></a>
In a January 1999 Wired
magazine article,[[71]](<Topic 48. The Essence of Agility - essence_of_agility.md#FOOTNOTE-71>) producer and musician
Brian Eno described an incredible piece of technology—the ultimate
mixing board. It does anything to sound that can be done. And yet,
instead of letting musicians make better music, or produce a recording
faster or less expensively, it gets in the way; it disrupts the creative
process.

<a id="d24e24651"></a>
To see why, you have to look at how recording engineers work. They
balance sounds intuitively. Over the years, they develop an
innate feedback loop between their ears and their
fingertips—sliding faders, rotating knobs, and so on. However, the
interface to the new mixer didn't leverage off those abilities.
Instead, it forced its users to type on a keyboard or click a mouse.
The functions it provided were comprehensive, but they were packaged
in unfamiliar and exotic ways. The functions the engineers needed
were sometimes hidden behind obscure names, or were achieved with
nonintuitive combinations of basic facilities.

<a id="d24e24653"></a>
This example also illustrates our belief that successful tools
adapt to the hands that use them. Successful requirements gathering
takes this into account. And this is why early feedback, with prototypes
or tracer bullets, will let your clients say “yes, it does what I
want, but not how I want.”

### Documenting Requirements

<a id="d24e24690"></a>
We believe that the best requirements documentation, perhaps the only
requirements documentation, is working code.

<a id="d24e24704"></a>
But that doesn't mean that you can get away without documenting your
understanding of what the client wants. It just means that those
documents are not a deliverable: they are not something that you give to
a client to sign off on. Instead, they are simply mileposts to help
guide the implementation process.

#### Requirements Documents Are Not for Clients

<a id="d24e24709"></a>
In the past, both Andy and Dave have been on projects that produced
incredibly detailed requirements. These substantial documents expanded
on the client's initial two-minute explanation of what was wanted,
producing inch-thick masterpieces full of diagrams and tables. Things
were specified to the point where there was almost no room for ambiguity
in the implementation. Given sufficiently powerful tools, the document
could actually be the final program.

<a id="d24e24723"></a>
Creating these documents was a mistake for two reasons. First, as we've
discussed, the client doesn't really know what they want up front. So
when we take what they say and expand it into what is almost a legal
document, we are building an incredibly complex castle on quicksand.

<a id="d24e24725"></a>
You might say “but then we take the document to the client and they sign
off on it. We're getting feedback.” And that leads us to the second
problem with these requirement specifications: the client never reads
them.

<a id="d24e24727"></a>
The client uses programmers because, while the client is motivated by
solving a high-level and somewhat nebulous problem, programmers are
interested in all the details and nuances. The requirements document is
written for developers, and contains information and subtleties that are
sometimes incomprehensible and frequently boring to the client.

<a id="d24e24729"></a>
Submit a 200-page requirements document, and the client will likely heft
it to decide if it weighs enough to be important, they may read the
first couple of paragraphs (which is why the first two paragraphs are
always titled Management Summary), and they may flick through the
rest, sometimes stopping when there's a neat diagram.

<a id="d24e24734"></a>
This isn't putting the client down. But giving them a large technical
document is like giving the average developer a copy of the Iliad in
Homeric Greek and asking them to code the video game from it.

#### Requirements Documents Are for Planning

<a id="d24e24742"></a>
So we don't believe in the monolithic, heavy-enough-to-stun-an-ox,
requirements document. We do, however, know that requirements have to be
written down, simply because developers on a team need to know what
they'll be doing.

<a id="d24e24744"></a>
What form does this take? We favor something that can fit on a real (or
virtual) index card. These short descriptions are often called user
stories. They describe what a small portion of the application should
do from the perspective of a user of that functionality.

<a id="d24e24761"></a>
When written this way, the requirements can be placed on a board and
moved around to show both status and priority.

<a id="d24e24763"></a>
You might think that a single index card can't hold the information
needed to implement a component of the application. You'd be right. And
that's part of the point. By keeping this statement of requirements
short, you're encouraging developers to ask clarifying questions. You're
enhancing the feedback process between clients and coders before and
during the creation of each piece of code.

### Overspecification

<a id="d24e24777"></a>
Another big danger in producing a requirements document is being too
specific. Good requirements are abstract. Where
requirements are concerned, the simplest statement that accurately
reflects the business need is best. This doesn't mean you can be
vague—you must capture the underlying semantic invariants as
requirements, and document the specific or current work practices as
policy.

<a id="d24e24786"></a>
Requirements are not architecture. Requirements are not design, nor
are they the user interface. Requirements are need.

### Just One More Wafer-Thin Mint…

<a id="d24e24798"></a>
Many project failures are blamed on an increase in scope—also known as
feature bloat, creeping featurism, or requirements creep. This is an
aspect of the boiled-frog syndrome from Topic 4, [*Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs*](<../01 Pragmatic Philosophy/04 Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs - stone_soup.md#stone_soup>).
What can we do to prevent requirements from creeping up on us?

<a id="d24e24822"></a>
The answer (again) is feedback. If you're working with the client in iterations with
constant feedback, then the client will experience first-hand the impact
of “just one more feature.” They'll see another story card go up on the
board, and they'll get to help choose another card to move into the next
iteration to make room. Feedback works both ways.

<a id="pglossary"></a>
### Maintain a Glossary

<a id="d24e24827"></a>
As soon as you start discussing requirements, users and domain
experts will use certain terms that have specific meaning to them.
They may differentiate between a “client” and a “customer,” for
example. It would then be inappropriate to use either word casually
in the system.

<a id="d24e24846"></a>
Create and maintain a project glossary—one place that defines
all the specific terms and vocabulary used in a project. All
participants in the project, from end users to support staff, should
use the glossary to ensure consistency. This implies that the glossary
needs to be widely accessible—a good argument for online
documentation.

**Tip 80: Use a Project Glossary**

<a id="d24e24857"></a>
It's hard to succeed on a project if users and developers
call the same thing by different names or, even worse, refer to
different things by the same name.
